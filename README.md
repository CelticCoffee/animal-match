# animal-match

This is a practice version of my puzzleChallenge.
It was a little more amusing looking at chickens and my little ponies while I was working on the code.  

Pure javascript.  Really nice to have the gauntlet thrown down of "no jQuery please."
  okay, there's of course jQuery in Bootstrap but this was about the logic not the visuals and Bootstrap is so fast and wonderful for throwing down a basic structure.

I used the Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm to make the images change each time the page reloads.  

The biggest challenge was to make things happen in the order that I wanted them to-- delaying certain styling and such til other things happened.

I think there is more fun to be had with this shuffling and matching thing.
